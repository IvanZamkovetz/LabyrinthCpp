# LabyrinthCpp
C++ console engine for building and passing labyrinths

Application intended for testing algorithms of building and passing different types of labyrinths.

Application functionality:
1. Loading algorithms libraries
2. View algorithms list to choose
3. Executing building, passing
4. Show process step-by-step

Application features:
1. Developed custom labyrinth data structure, combined from STL list and map
2. Single responsibility pattern
3. Using boost smart pointers
